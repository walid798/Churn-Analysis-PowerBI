# Churn-Analysis-PowerBI
# Overview
This project is part of the Data Visualization track at the Information Technology Institute (ITI). It focuses on understanding and analyzing customer churn, a critical business problem where customers stop using a service or product. By leveraging Power BI, DAX measures, and detailed data analysis, the project identifies trends and provides actionable insights to reduce churn rates and improve customer retention.

# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:

1. Identify the factors contributing to customer churn.
2. Visualize customer behavior and churn patterns using interactive dashboards.
3. Provide actionable recommendations to improve retention rates.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes customer-related attributes such as demographic details, subscription information, and service usage patterns.

## Key Attributes:

- Customer ID, Gender, Senior Citizen, Partner, Dependents
- Tenure, Monthly Charges, Total Charges
- Contract Type, Payment Method, Internet Services, and Churn

# Key Features and Analysis Steps
## Data Cleaning and Preparation:

- Cleaned the dataset using Power Query to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
- Transformed categorical data into a structured format suitable for analysis.

# DAX Calculations:

Developed custom DAX measures to calculate critical metrics such as churn rate, average tenure, and customer segmentation.

# Interactive Dashboard:
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize:
  - Overall churn rate
  - Customer behavior across contract types and services
  - Average tenure by demographic groups
  - Trends in churned and retained customers

# Insights and Recommendations:

- Answered critical business questions like:
- Which contract type has the highest churn rate?
- What is the average tenure of churned vs. retained customers?
- Do customers with certain services churn more frequently?


# Key Insights

## Churn Trends:

- Customers with month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate.
- Customers with electronic check payment methods are more likely to churn compared to those using  credit cards or bank transfers.

# Customer Behavior:

- Senior citizens and customers without dependents have higher churn rates.
- Customers with longer tenures are more likely to stay.

# Service Usage:

- Customers using fiber-optic internet churn more frequently than those with DSL.
- Customers subscribed to multiple services churn less often.

# Recommendations
- Offer incentives like discounts or perks for customers on month-to-month contracts to encourage long-term commitments.
- Educate customers using electronic checks about more convenient and reliable payment methods like bank transfers or credit cards.
- Introduce loyalty programs targeting senior citizens and customers without dependents to improve retention.
- Address issues with fiber-optic internet services to improve satisfaction and reduce churn.
